This is a OpenGL Sandbox project. I use this project to learn OpenGL and 3D programming concepts.

I configureted whole project to be click and run on Visual Studio. You should build flawless on VS.
I tried to organise all files neatly. So, it should not be hard to build with other IDEs, compilers, etc.

I also used other external libraries like GLFW, GLAD, GLM, STB_I so it is important to read their licences too.
